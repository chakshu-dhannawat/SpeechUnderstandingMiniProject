# SpeechUnderstandingMiniProject
This repository contains code for the speech understanding mini project. In this project I have worked on seaker identification using classical methods such as HMM's and GMM's.
Here, I have maindy extracted features using the MFCC coefficients, and compared them with a pool of speakers, to find the colsest match. I have used the VoxForge Dataset for this purpose.
