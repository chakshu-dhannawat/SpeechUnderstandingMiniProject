Key Highlights:

 - Using MFCC's(13 features) along with the derivative(delta) and second order derivative(delta^2) is usually more beneficial, thus, extracting 39 features.
   This way, we not only extract  'Short-term spectral features' but also, 'Spectro-temporal features'

 - Two ways of speaker identification/verification: text-dependent and text-independent.
   For text-independent, generally GMM(or other generative models) work best.
   For text-independent, discriminative models such as SVM's or probabilistic models such as HMM's work best.

- VQ(Vector Quantization) can be used to calculate the minimum distance between the given feature set(input signal) and the feature sets of our speakers.
